arachne
=======

A blog which makes it easy to weave together an argument by quoting sources
from around the web souch as other blogs, magazines, etc.

I predict the idea will work better if the quoted sections are fairly large and
the quoted blogs have interesting but more or less faint backgrounds that
scretch behind the text, but only time will tell for sure.

Principals:

* The reader is in control.  This is the prime directive.

* Capture irrevocable proof of everything over some measure of importance ASAP.


Features:

* Scrapes and saves the blog as close as possible to the timestamp of the
  post.

* Uses a cloud screenshot service to snapshot the blog as close as possible to
  the timestmap of the post.

* Emebds the quoted blogs in the our blog.  Occasionally checks to make sure
  they are still up and haven't changed.

    - If they have changed, re-scrape/screenshot/etc. and note the change
      with history on our blog with appropriate archive links.

    - If it's down replace with archive link.

* When one arachne instance quotes another arachne instance or some other
  software that adheres to [strawman]a generalized microformat[/strawman]
  it embeds the recursive instance in a way that puts the viewer in control
  of the experience of whether they read it nested or not.
